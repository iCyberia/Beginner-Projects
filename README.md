# Compound Interest Calculator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This calculator utilized C++ to calculate compound interest and show the potential interest earned.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe the simplicity of the cody was done well. This combined with the correct formatting makes the tables easily readable.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The only shortfall is with large numbers. Beyond 10 digits the tables begin to break and push the lines over. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part was the object oriented programing. I struggled to really wrap my head around this. I utilized online resources like youtube to find tutorials of similar projects and worked from there..

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
THe deep dive into OOP I'm sure will help me substantually in the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using easily readable and well defined code it's easy for anyone to pickup and read through.
